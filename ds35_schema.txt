DVD Store Release 3 Database Schema
-----------------------------------

A complete set of these tables is created for each store with a number 
at the end of each name to denote which store.

Stored Procedures   
-----------------

The DVD Store database is managed through 17 stored procedures. The first two are used during the login phase. 
If the customer is a returning customer, Login is used to retrieve the customer's information, in particular 
the CUSTOMERID. If the customer is a new customer, New_customer is used to create a new row in the Customers 
table with the user's data. If a customer wants to become a preimum member, the new_member procedure will add an
existing customer as a premium member. Following the login phase the customer might search for a DVD by category, 
actor or title. These are implemented by Browse_by_category, Browse_by_actor and Browse_by_title, respectively. 
The product reviews are returned by a set of stored procedures that provide different types of result sets.  
The get_prod_reviews procedure returns the most helpful reveiws for a specific product.  The 
get_prod_reviews_by_stars returns the most helpful reviews for a specific review star rating. The
get_prod_reviews_by_date returns the most recent reveiws for a specific product. The get_prod_reviews_by_actor 
and by_title return reviews based on a search by actor or title.  Finally, after the user has made his or her 
selections, the Purchase stored procedure is called to complete the transaction.
   
The stored procedures of the DS3 application have features to better model today's online stores. 
During Login, for example, the user's previous order (up to ten titles) is reported, along with titles 
that other customers who like those titles have recommended. The Browse_by_category returns those titles 
in the specified category that are currently on sale. And the Purchase stored procedure now checks the QUAN_IN_STOCK 
field from the Inventory table to see if a title is available. This is done using a database transaction, 
so that if there is insufficient quantity to fill the order neither the QUAN_IN_STOCK data is updated 
nor is a new record written to the ORDERS table. 
        

Driver Program
--------------    

A multi-threaded driver program, included with DS3, is used to simulate an order entry or online 
transaction processing (OLTP) workload. Each thread of the OLTP driver application connects to the database 
(either directly or through a web layer) and makes a series of stored procedure calls that simulates users 
logging in, browsing products and reviews, and purchasing.  Each completed sequence by a customer is counted 
as a single order. The driver measures order rates and the average response time to complete each order. 
Several tunable parameters are used to control the application and are described below.

Enter parameters with format --parm_name=parm_value
And/or use a config file with argument --config_file=(config file path)
Parms will be evaluated left to right

Parameter Name      Description                                         Default Value

config_file         config file path                                    none

pct_newmember       percent of orders with cust membership upgrade      1
n_searches          average number of searches per order                3
search_batch_size   average number of items returned in each search     5
n_reviews           average number of product review searches per order 3
pct_newreviews      percent of orders where customer creates a review   5
pct_newhelpfulness  pct of orders where review helpfulness is rated     10
n_line_items        average number of items per order                   5
virt_dir            virtual directory (for web driver)                  ds3
page_type           web page type (for web driver)                      php
windows_perf_host   target hostname for Perfmon CPU% display (Windows only)
linux_perf_host     username:password:target hostname/IP Address for Linux CPU% display (Linux Only)
detailed_view       Detailed statistics View (Y / N)                    N
out_filename        output results to specified file in csv format
ds2_mode            run driver in ds2 mode to mimic previous version    N
n_stores            Number of stores in DS3 instance                    1
log_freq            print output frequency in seconds                   10
log_timestamp       Detailed timestamp format for log (UTC / LOCAL / NONE) NONE


So with the default settings, the average order consists of 1 login/new customer create step, 3 searches, 
20 review searches, 3 percent new reviews, 5 percent review helpfulnss rating, 1 percent new membership, 
and 1 purchase.  The delay_time may be set to a typical user read/think/type time for an order so that the 
number of threads then corresponds to the number of simultaneous users. Or an extremely small delay
is used so that the database connections are kept full, simulating what happens in a real multi-tiered 
application where some small number of connections are pooled and shared among the web servers 
that may be handling thousands of simultaneous customers. Thus a realistic simulation of database activity is 
achieved without needing to model thousands of users.
