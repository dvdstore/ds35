To use the driver program you will need a windows based system with .net framework installed.  
In the initial version of DVD Store 3 .net framework 4.5 and MySQL .Net Connector version 6.9.6 was used.  If you have a different version of either .net or the MySQL .Net Connector it might be necessary to recompile the driver program before it will run.  

It is a fairly simple (not too difficult) command line based compile.  In the ds3xdrvier.cs file header the compile instructions are included and also covered here as well in a little more detail.

Download the ds3u1.tar and ds3u1mysql.tar files and extract all contents on the windows client.

Download the MySQL .Net Connector from the dev.mysql.com website - http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/

Run the .net connector installer - mysql-connector-net-6.9.6.msi -> Next, Typical, Install, Finish. 
This will install the MySQL.Data.dll that is needed for the driver program to execute. 
	
If your version of the .net connector is different than above, you will need to recompile the driver program as below.

Recompile the driver program to use the new MySQL.Data.dll that comes with the current version of the connector:

C:\ds3\drivers>c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe /out:ds3mysqldriverNew.exe ds3xdriver.cs c:\ds3\mysqlds3\ds3mysqlfns.cs /d:USE_WIN32_TIME
R /d:GEN_PERF_CTRS /r:"c:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Connector Net 6.9.6\Assemblies\v4.0\MySql.Data.dll"

To make the command much shorter, you can add the csc.exe into the PATH environment variable, and have the two source .cs files copied into the same directory.
