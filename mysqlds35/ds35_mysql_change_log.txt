DVD Store 3 

6/2/15:  Updated / Enhanced from version 2.1 to 3.0.  Added new tables and 
indexes to support product reviews, user base product reviews helpfulness, 
and premium membership.  Driver program was also updated to be able to support 
the new DS3 order process that adds new members, browsing reviews by title, 
actor, date, and star rating.  Build scripts are updated to create the new REVEIWS, 
REVIEWS_HELPFULNESS, and MEMBERSHIP tables and the associated indexes.  New 
stored proecedures were created for the NEW_REVIEWS, NEW_REVIEWS_HELPFULENSS, 
and NEW_MEMBER operations.  

DVD Store 3.5/05

2/11/20  Updated from 3.0 to 3.5. Added the capability to have multiple stores in a 
single DVD store database.  This allows for a specficied numaber of stores to be 
created each with their own set of tables and data.  Build and load scripts now
load data in parallel for tables and stores resulting in much faster load times. 
Additionally, complete database creation and loading can be done remotely with a 
single script call from both windows and linux clients.  New perl scripts have been
added that do all of this with just the required arguemnts of the host and number of stores.
